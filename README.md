# morning-programs

### Overview

Programming equivalent to reading the newspaper or completing a sudoku puzzle in the morning.  The plan is to spend 20 
minutes in the morning on a programming problem.  Some programs will take multiple days to solve, and some will be left 
unsolved (if they are incomplete after three days).
